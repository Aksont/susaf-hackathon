The development of this project was done through a Sustainability-themed Hackathon conducted at LUT University.

The goal of the hackathon is to design and develop a web tool that digitizes SUSAF. The Sustainability Awareness Framework (SusAF) is a tool for the sustainable design of software products and services that help companies link sustainability mission and goals to IT products and services. Moreover, it also helps:

- Identify the sustainability impacts of IT products and services for companies, product managers, software developers, consultants, students
- Visualize the chain of effects for all identified impacts in each sustainability dimension and three orders of effects to aid:
- Visualization of sustainability impacts from different stakeholder lenses (CEO/ Product manager/ developer/ student)
- Discussion among different stakeholders
- Transform identified sustainability impacts and effects of IT products and services into the product roadmap, features requirements or user stories, SCRUM (product backlog, sprint planning, backlog, review, retrospective)
- Create awareness about the sustainability impacts of IT products and services among software engineering professionals and students

**SusDigi** is the name of our tool that incorporates the project management attributes of **JIRA**, the organizational creation of sustainability impacts through **spreadsheets**, and the collaborative visualization of the **SUSAF** framework through **MIRO BOARD**, all in one screen to facilitate the process of assessing the sustainability impacts of every feature being worked on.
